		<![CDATA[Render an HTML "a" anchor element.  The value of the
                component is rendered as the value of the "href" attribute.  Any
                child UIParameter components are appended to the String to be
                output as the value of the "href" attribute as query parameters
                before rendering.  The entire "href" string must be passed through
                a call to the <code>encodeResourceURL()</code> method of the
                <code>ExternalContext</code>.  The name of the UIParameter goes on
                the left hand side, and the value of the UIParameter on the right
                hand side.  The name and the value must be URLEncoded.  Each
                UIParameter instance is separated by an ampersand, as dictated in
                the URL spec.  If the "styleClass" attribute is specified, render
                its value as the value of the "class" attribute.
