          Behavior for UISelectMany Components"</a> section.</p></ul><p>Encode Behavior</p><ul><p>Render a "table" element.  If the "styleClass" is specified, render the 
          value of the "styleClass" attribute as the value of the "class" attribute 
          on the "table" element. If the "style", "border" attributes are specified,
          pass them thru.  If the "layout" attribute is specified, and its
          value is "spread", let the checkbox tag do the rendering.
          If the "layout" attribute is specified, and its
          value is "pageDirection", render the children elements vertically,
          otherwise horizontally, in the table.  If any of the children are
          an instance of SelectItemGroup, render them as a nested table.
          Each of the children are ultimately rendered as follows.  Render
          a "label" element. Inside of the "label", render an "input" element
          of "type" "checkbox" for each child component.  As an exception to
          the general rules about how to handle the "id" attribute, render it
          as an attribute on the outer "table" element, the value of which is the 
          <code>clientId</code> of the component per the rules at the beginning 
          of this specification.The "id" attribute must not be output on each "input" 
          element. The value of the current SelectItem is rendered as the value of
          the "value" attribute.  If the value of the enclosing UISelectMany
          matches the current value, render "checked" as the value of the
          "checked" attribute.  If the current SelectItem.isDisabled()
          returns true, render "disabled" as the value of the "disabled"
          attribute.  Close out the "input" element and render the return
          value from SelectItem.getLabel().  Close out the "label" element
          and any other nested elements.  See the <a href="javax.faces.SelectManyjavax.faces.Listbox.html#options">"Rendering
          the option elements" </a> specification for
          <code>ListboxRenderer</code> for more detail on how to render the
          "option" elements in this renderer.</p></ul>]]>
