            <p>Decode Behavior</p><ul><p>Obtain the <code>Map</code> from the
                "requestParameterMap"
                property of the <code>ExternalContext</code>. If the map contains
                an entry for the "clientId" of this <code>UIForm</code> component,
                call <code>setSubmitted(true)</code> on the form, otherwise call
                <code>setSubmitted(false)</code> on the form.</p></ul>

            <p>Encode Behavior</p>

            <ul><p>The value of the "method" attribute must be
                "post". The value
                of the "action" attribute must be the result of passing the view
                identifier of the current view to the <code>getActionURL()</code>
                method of the <code>ViewHandler</code> for this application,
                then passing that String to the <code>encodeActionURL()</code>
                method on the <code>ExternalContext</code>. If the "styleClass"
                attribute is specified, render its value as the value of the
                "class" attribute. Render all the necessary hidden fields for all
                commandLink instances in the page just before the close of the
                "form" element.</p>
