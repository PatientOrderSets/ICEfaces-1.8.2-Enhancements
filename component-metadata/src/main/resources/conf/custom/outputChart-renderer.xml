The outputChart component uses the JCharts open source charting utility
(http://jcharts.sourceforge.net/) to create charts.
All chart types are derived from the two main types:
        <ol>
            <li>axis : 
		        <ul>
		            <li>area</li/>
		            <li>areastacked</li/>
		            <li>bar</li/>
		            <li>barclustered</li/>
		            <li>barstacked</li/>
		            <li>line</li/>
		            <li>point</li/>
		            <li>stock</li/>                                                                                                         
		        </ul>
            </li>
            <li>pie : 
                <ul>
                    <li>pie2D</li/>
                    <li>pie3D</li/>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <b>Note:</b> The "type" attribute can be changed using the value binding 
        for one basic type only. For example you can change "area" to "bar", "bar" to 
        "line" but not to "pie2d"
