            <p>The selectInputText component provides an inputText component enhanced with auto-complete functionality.
            As the user enters text into the component it provides a popup list of possible matching values that the
            user may select from. The component predicts a word or phrase that a user wants to type in without the user
            actually completely typing it in. The selectInputText component requires developers to implement the 
            matching list search algorithm in their backing bean.
            <p>
            The selectInputText component can generate one of two types of lists:<br/>
            
               1. A list of String data.<br/>
               2. A list of arbitrarily complex child components.<br/><br/>
               
           The server call delay frequency can be configured using the "options" attribute. Please see the description of 
           "options" attribute for detail.
