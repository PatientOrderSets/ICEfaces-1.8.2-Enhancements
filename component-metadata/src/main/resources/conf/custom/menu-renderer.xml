        <p>The menuBar component provides a robust menu system that supports:</p>
        <ol>
           <li>Nested child menuItem and menuItemSeparator components. Support for menuItemCheckbox and menuItemRadio
           components are planned for a future release.</li>

           <li>Horizontal (default) and Vertical menu orientations. Defines whether the submenus of the top-level
           menu items appear beside or below the top-level menu items.</li>

           <li> Definition of the heirarchy of menu items and their submenus in one of two ways:
                <ul>
                   <li>by using a binding to a bean method that returns a (potentially) dynamic heirarchy of menu items.</li>
                   <li>by statically defining the heirarchy in the JSPX page.</li>
                </ul>
           </li>

           <li>The action attribute of the contained menuItem tags or instances can be defined to indicate a string or
           a backing bean method that can be used in application navigation.</li>

           <li>The actionListener attribute of the contained menuItem tags or instances can be defined to indicate an
           actionListener that resides in a backing bean.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>See the menuItem component's description for more relevant information.</p>]]>
