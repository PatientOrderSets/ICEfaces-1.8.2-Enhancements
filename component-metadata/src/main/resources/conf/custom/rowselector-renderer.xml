		The Row Selector tag enables single and multiple row selection 
		for DataTable. To add the row selection to the dataTable, the rowSelector
		component can be added to any column of the dataTable(e.g.)
		<p>
		&lt;ice:dataTable..&gt;<br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ice:column&gt;<br/>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ice:rowSelector .../&gt; <br/>
		       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;f:facet name="header"&gt;<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ice:outputText ..../&gt;<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/f:facet&gt;<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ice:outputText ...../&gt;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/ice:column&gt;<br/>
        </p>   
        
        <b>Note:</b> 
        <ul>
        <li>        
        there should be only one rowSelector component inside a dataTable.
        <p> The row selection will fire a <i>RowSelectorEvent</i> which can be caught by
        the <i>selectionListener</i> on this component.
        </p>
        
        <p>The selection is based on the following two attributes:
        <ul>
            <li>multiple</li>
            <li>enhancedMultiple</li>
        </ul>
        By default the component runs in single selection mode. In which selecting a row
        deselects the previously selected row. Setting "multiple" to true, puts the component in
        multiple selection mode, which allows you to select multiple rows but you
        can not use "ctrl" or "shift" keys for selection. <br>
        Setting the "enhancedMultiple" to true, allows single or muliple selection 
        using the shift or ctrl keys combination. For more detail please see the 
        attribute specific description. 
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    It is a good practice to use the immediate parameter of the rowSelector. If set to true, it will work with the results
     of the selection in APPLY_REQUEST_VALUE phase, before validation occurs. If set to false it will defer event
     processing until INVOKE_APPLICATION phase, after validation. If validation fails, selection event will not fire with
     immediate=false
     </li>
     <li>    
      The event lists selection changes tied to the event, not the total model 
      state. So the RowSelectorEvent.getSelectedRows() can return multiple rows 
      only when the selection was made using the "shift" key in enhancedMultiple 
      mode, other wise it returns a single rowindex. To determine all the 
      currently selected rows in a dataTable the application needs to query the model 
      </li>
      </ul>
