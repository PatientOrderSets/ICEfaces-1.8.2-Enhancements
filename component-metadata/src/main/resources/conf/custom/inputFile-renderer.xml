		<![CDATA[<p>The inputFile component can be used to provide a user-specified file upload capability.<br>
		    The inputFile component renders an file input HTML element. Users specify a file to upload
            either by entering the path to a file directly, or by  clicking the  <b>Browse</b>  button
            to open a file-system navigation dialog window.  Clicking the  <b>Upload</b>  button uploads
            the specified file to the server.<br>
            Note: Newer browsers now make the field, where users previously could type in the file path,
            be read-only, to prevent users from entering invalid file paths. Clicking into that field can 
            summon the file selection dialog, just as clicking on the  <b>Browse</b>  button would.<br>
            Note: The web.xml parameter com.icesoft.faces.uploadDirectoryAbsolute when set to true will use 
            the value of the com.icesoft.faces.uploadDirectory parameter as an absolute directory.<br>
            Note: If the styleClass, buttonClass or the inputTextClass need to be set, then the css file
            must be referenced using the ice:outputStyle component.<br/>
            Note: In order to set the height and width of this component, it is recomended to use the height and the width
            attribute of this component instead of setting it using the style or styleClass. This is due to 
            the rendering of an iframe.
