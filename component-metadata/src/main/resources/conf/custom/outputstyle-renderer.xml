         <p>The outputStyle component is used to link the desired ICEfaces 
            theme CSS stylesheets into the page to style the ICEfaces 
            Component Suite components.</p>
         <p>Inserting the outputStyle component into the HEAD region of a 
            page will link both the default CSS stylesheet for the theme and 
            optionally an additional stylesheet that alters the default 
            styles to accommodate differences in CSS rendering in various 
            user-agents/browsers.</p>
         <p>The additional style sheet will have a different extension for 
            each browser.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Internet Explorer < 7 = _ie.css</li>
              <li>Internet Explorer 7 = _ie7.css</li>
              <li>Internet Explorer 8 = _ie8.css</li>
              <li>Safari = _safari.css</li>
              <li>Sun Studio Creator = _dt.css</li>
            </ul>
         <p>This extension replaces the .css value of the href attribute.
            So when href is 'xp.css' and the page is rendered in Internet 
            Explorer 6 or less, an additional style sheet will be included 
            called 'xp_ie.css'.</p>
