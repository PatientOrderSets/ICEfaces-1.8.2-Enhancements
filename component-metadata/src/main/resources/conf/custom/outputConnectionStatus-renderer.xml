        <p>The outputConnectionStatus component displays the information about the status of the network connection
        between the client browser and the server. The component displays one of 4 possible states, which are as
        follows.
        <p>
           1. Active: The connection is alive and there is a request pending.<br/>
           2. Inactive: The connection is alive and there is no pending activity.<br/>
           3. Caution: The connection request/response latency has exceeded the configured threshold.
           Indicates that asynchronous updates from the server may not be received in a timely manner.<br/>
           4. Disconnected: The connection has been lost, either due to network or application error
           (session expiry, etc.).<br/>
        <p>
        The outputConnectionStatus component provides an ideal mechanism to provide continuous real-time feedback
        to users of the status of their ICEfaces application. It is particularly important to inform users when the
        application is busy sending and receiving data in response to a user-initiated action to manage their 
        expectations with respect to application readiness for additional user input. Generally, the
        outputConnectionStatus component should be located in a consistent location throughout an ICEfaces application.
        <p>
        NOTE: A web-page may only contain a single outputConnectionStatus component. Using more than one 
        outputConnectionStatus component on the same web page will result in erratic results.
