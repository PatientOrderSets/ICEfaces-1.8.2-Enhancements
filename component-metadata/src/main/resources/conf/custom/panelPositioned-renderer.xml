             <![CDATA[ With the positioned panel component lists can be used to 
             generate a series of repeating child-components within a panel. 
             Each one of these child-components is draggable and can exchange 
             positions with other children in the same panel as well as a child 
             component can be moved between different positioned panels components. 
             When a Child Component is moved the source value (java.util.List/Array ) 
             for the positioned Panel is modified by the component to reflect the 
             new order of the positioned panel. <br/>
             (e.g.) <br/>
            
            &lt;ice:panelPositioned var="person" <br/>
                                 value="#{panelPositioned.people}"
                                &gt;<br/>
                &lt;ice:panelGroup style="cursor:move;"&gt;<br/>
                        &lt;ice:outputText value="#{person.name}"/&gt;<br/>
                &lt;/ice:panelGroup&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/ice:panelPositioned&gt;    <br/>
