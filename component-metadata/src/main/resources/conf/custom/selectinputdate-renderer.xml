		<![CDATA[<p>The selectInputDate component renders a localized dateSelect. Users may select a date by clicking
            on a date in the displayed month. The displayed month and year can be changed using arrow buttons or dropdown lists.
            Optionally, the selectInputDate component may be used in popup mode. In this mode an inputText
            component is rendered that displays the selected date. Users may enter a date directly into the
            inputText component, or optionally click a button beside the inputText component to display a popup
            dateSelect view. Selecting a date in the dateSelect closes  the popup dateSelect view and updates the
            selected date.<br>
            The selectInputDate component can be used in cases where a date value must be displayed or entered. 
            <p>
             In order to highlight a day, following three attributes need to be 
             set with corresponding values:
            <ol>
                <li> highlightClass
            	<li> highlightUnit   
            	<li> highlightValue
            </ol>
            (e.g.)
            &lt;ice:selectInputDate highlighClass="newyear"
            					 highlightUnit="DAY_OF_YEAR"
            					 highlightValue="1" /&gt;
            <p>					 	
            To highlighting days in more granular fashion, above attributes can 
            be set to defining more then one rules by separating them with : 
            colon (e.g.)<br/>

            &lt;ice:selectInputDate highlighClass="newyear: weekend"
            					 highlightUnit="DAY_OF_YEAR: DAY_OF_WEEK"
            					 highlightValue="1: 7" /&gt;
            </p>
            <p>					 	
            A rule can be set to defining more then one values using comma "," (e.g.)<br/>
            &lt;ice:selectInputDate highlighClass="newyear: weekend"
            					 highlightUnit="DAY_OF_YEAR: DAY_OF_WEEK"
            					 highlightValue="1: 1, 7" /&gt;	 <br/>
            </p>            
            
			NOTE: all 3 highlight attributes should have a corresponding values.<br/>
                  The action and actionListener will only be fired, when "enter" 
                  being pressed on a input text in a popup mode.<br/><br/> 

            Time Entry: When the f:convertDateTime is configured to show time, the calendar will include a time editing UI.
