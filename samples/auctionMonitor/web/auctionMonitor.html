	    You are about to interact with a JSF application powered by ICEsoft's Direct-to-DOM (D2D) rendering technology. 
        <p>D2D rendering provides unparalleled richness to JSF applications through incremental browser DOM updates and a fine-grained partial submit mechanism, all delivered via a lightweight JavaScript bridge to any modern commercial browser. This is not an ad hoc AJAX implementation requiring intricate and torturous JavaScript programming to achieve richness, but a pure JSF application (using only standard JSF components) that benefits directly, and transparently from the underlying D2D mechanism.</p>
	<p>As you will notice immediately from the ticking clocks in the "Time Left" column, asynchronous, real time, presentation layer updates are delivered to the client browser. You will see that as bids are generated from one client, other client presentations are updated to reflect the changes. You will also notice that there are no full page refreshes required, and your user context (scroll bars, input focus, etc...) is preserved even as the presentation changes before your eyes. </p>
	<p>After only a brief interaction with this application you will begin to realize that D2D delivers richness not possible in standard web applications, and that D2D opens up a whole new class of rich web-based applications.</p>
