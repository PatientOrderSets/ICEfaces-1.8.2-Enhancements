<h2>ICEsoft ICEfaces AddressForm Demo</h2>
<p>
    This is a basic demo that illustrates intelligent form processing using
    ICEfaces and the partial submit mechanism. It is based on entering a USA
    address, but uses partial submits to analyse and manipulate user input to
    ensure that a complete valid address is obtained prior to form submission.
    As you interact with this JSF application, you will find the Direct-to-DOM
    experience to be enriched in a number of ways. It is important to note that
    these rich features do not rely on a bunch of JavaScript in the page, but
    instead leverage the power and resource of the server through ICEfaces.

        <h3>Input Formatting:</h3>

        <p>The first and last name field will autocorrect for capitalization
            when you tab out of them.

        <h3>Incremental Form Validation:</h3>

        <p>Address, City and State are validated against a server-side address
            database to ensure they are correct. These validations take place as
            you tab out of the field, ensuring that you are informed of errors
            as they happen.

        <h3>Inter-field Validation:</h3>

        <p>Not only can you run basic validation against individual fields, you
            can do inter-field analysis for more complex validation. In this
            demo we analyse City, State, and Zip against the server-side address
            database to ensure they represent a correct address.

        <h3>Form Control Manipulation:</h3>

        <p>
            As the form is being completed we can manipulate the form controls
            to aid the user in entering the form. For instance, if you enter a
            valid City, the State input text field morphs to a drop-down
            selection with only States that match the City. If you then select a
            valid State, the Zip input text field will do the same and present a
            list of valid Zip codes for that City and State. Likewise, if you
            enter a Zip first, the City and State will autofill with correct
            values.

        <h3>Submit Suppression:</h3>

        <p>
            You may have noticed that the Submit button is inactive during form
            entry. It is not activated for the user until the form is known to
            be completed fully and contains a valid City, State and Zip for the
            address. This means that we can drastically reduce form entry errors
            prior to submission.

        <h3>Internet Explorer Keyboard Navigation:</h3>

        <p>
            Internet Explorer users who use the keyboard to navigate should open
            menus using (Alt + Down Arrow) keys before navigating the menu with
            the arrow keys. Then the (Enter) key should be used to select a menu
            item. When a menu is not open, prior to navigation, Internet Explorer
            will process the onchange event on the first (Down Arrow) key event.
            Resulting in the selection of an item the user may not have intended
            to select.
